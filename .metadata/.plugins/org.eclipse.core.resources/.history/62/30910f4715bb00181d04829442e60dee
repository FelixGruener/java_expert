/*
----------
Task 1
----------
Implement a method processNames(...). It should be possible to pass a list of names (of type String), a condition and the action which should be executed for each name to this method.
=> condition: use Predicate<String> interface, method test(...)
=> action: use Consumer<String> interface, method accept(...)

----------
Task 2
----------
Implement an event processor for which interested systems can register (also unregister). All registered systems will be informed about new events (events have a type, ...) - and maybe execute a specific action.
=> Observer/Listener pattern
